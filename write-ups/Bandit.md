# [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) CTF
### Bandit is a beginner CTF aimed towards absolute beginners. I recommend if you are using this write-up as a guide to do your own research before you copy the solutions. Remeber the goal of CTF's is to learn and have fun. Happy Hunting!
## Brief Overview:
We will be learning a lot about basic linux commands, if you do not have any experience in linux I **HIGHLY** recommend that you read the man page of every command we use. This CTF is can be accessed from any machine, as we are going to ssh into the server. If you want you can use [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), but the command line will work just fine.
### What is SSH?
Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), is a networking protocol that allows us to securely access and manage network devices and servers. Basically you can login and execute commands on the system without actually having to be there.
